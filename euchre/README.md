# Euchre

Play games of Euchre and analyze the results

## Goal: 
Create a fully functional euchre game to better understand winning probabilities of different starting hands

### Identify Optimal Strategy
How much does it increase the expected points earned from a hand if a player 'plays into' partners short-suit?

### Build a Model to Predict Points Scored From Given Hand
Answering the question:
Given the cards in a players hand (and position at the table), what is the likelihood of winning each number of tricks that hand? 

### Future Ideas:
* Streamlit app where user can select cards in hand and table position and get breakdown of likelihood of taking 5/4/3/2/1/0 tricks
* Genetic Algorithm to determine next play would be cool - start with random strategy, adapt to new weights as games progress
* PySimpleGUI to learn to play game
  * Hide/show opponents hands
  * Keep list of cards played, trump left
