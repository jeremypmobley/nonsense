# Kaggle Allstate Claims Severity Competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity

## Files Included:
- kaggle_allstate_perf_eval_tradeoff
	- Modeling script with a focus on local cross validation performance compared with model training computational performance
- kaggle_allstate_lev1_xgboost
	- Modeling script using xgboost
	- Meant to be used as a level 1 model input to a larger stacked design, didn't quite get there.
- kaggle_allstate_claims_severity
	- General modeling script
- kaggle_allstate_caret
	- Modeling script using caret package
	- Computational performance using defaults is terrible
	- Need to add this file


### Summary:
Didn't make enough time to put together a legitimate solution for this competition.

This competition quickly degraded into an evaluation of who had the most processing power to run through as many possible iterations of feature transformations as can be imagined.
